# Rosalind 

This repository contains my solutions to problems in Rosalind.

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. It offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.
